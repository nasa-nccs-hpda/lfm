    noise_shift = 1.0 corresponds to the standard cosine noise schedule.
    0 < noise_shift < 1.0 corresponds to a less noisy schedule (better
    suited if the conditioning is highly informative, e.g. low-res images).
    noise_shift > 1.0 corresponds to a more noisy schedule (better suited
    if the conditioning is not as informative, e.g. captions).
